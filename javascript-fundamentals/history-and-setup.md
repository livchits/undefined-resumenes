#JavaScript History and Setup

##Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that is essential for web development. Any web page you interact with today, JavaScript is most likely providing the action on the page. With modern tools like Node.js,JavaScript can now also be used to save data to a database or to create desktop applications. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three major tools you'll need to understand if you want to build a modern website. 

JavaScript was created in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, then working at Netscape and now of Mozilla. The original name was Mocha, a name chosen by Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape. In September of 1995 the name was changed to LiveScript, then in December of the same year, upon receiving a trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted. 

##ECMAScript

What's the difference between ECMAScript and JavaScript? ECMAScript is a standard. JavaScript is an implementation of that standard. The standard dictates certain features and sets of functionality, but there can be different implementations that follow the standard. There are many different JavaScript engines that implement the ECMAScript standard and are competing for dominance; the most popular right now is Google's V8 engine.

JavaScript standardization is now run by a committee called TC39, which governs how ECMAScript features are designed, starting with ECMAScript 2016 (or what is called ES2016).

##Tools For JavaScript Development

To open a console using Chrome press `Control + Shift + j`. Another way to get to the console is to right click on the web page, select Inspect, and then move to the tab called `Console`.

You can tell JavaScript to log a message directly to the console, using a function called console.log:

`console.log('This is less obtrusive.');`

 If you would like to clear the console you can either type in `clear()` and press enter or press `Control + k`.

If you need to write code that spans multiple lines, you'll need to type `shift + enter` to get a line break in the console, since just hitting `enter` executes your code.
